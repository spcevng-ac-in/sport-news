# Sports News and Scores Dashboard

The Sports News and Scores Dashboard is a web application that provides users with up-to-date sports news articles and live scores for various sports. It allows users to stay informed about their favourite sports, read news articles, and track live match scores, all in one place. Additionally, users can personalize their dashboard by selecting their favourite sports or teams to receive tailored news and score updates.

This unified proposal combines the ability to browse sports news and scores with the option to personalize the dashboard through account creation and customization of preferences. Users can filter news articles, search for specific articles, and view live scores, all while having the ability to personalize their dashboard according to their preferences
